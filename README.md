# promwrapgen

> promwrapgen wraps an interface or a struct and adds prometheus metrics such as success count, error count, total count and duration


THIS IS A WIP

## TODO

- [x] Handle slice ... operator
- [x] Only work on targets passed not all interfaces in file
- [ ] Pass method name and other method related information Total, Success and Error
- [ ] Get list of targets not just one
- [ ] Let users decided what metrics they want
- [ ] Handle `time` package conflict
- [ ] Some logic is stupid and slow but finish it first for prometheus metric only on interfaces and then refactor.
- [ ] Add struct wrapping support?? What if struct methods are in multiple files???
- [ ] Extract wrapping funtionality.
- [ ] Enable users to extend wrapping functionallity to add custom logic to their interfaces
- [ ] Custom metrics?
- [ ] Refactor and make it more clever.
